# Multidimensional-Scaling-of-European_Cities
This project explores the spatial relationships between twenty European cities using classical manual Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), MDS from scikit-learn, and compares the results with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It contains the visualizations and analysis results in the notebook.

## Contents
- **Multidimensional scaling of European Cities.ipynb:** The Jupyter notebook containing the project.
- **README.md:** Brief overview of the project.

## Execution Environment
The project is developed and executed in a Google Colab environment. 

## Execution Flow
1. Classical manual MDS: Implementing Multidimensional Scaling manually to explore spatial relationships.
2. MDS from scikit-learn: Utilizing the MDS implementation from scikit-learn library for comparison.
3. PCA Comparison: Applying Principal Component Analysis to compare results with MDS.

## Dependencies
- Python
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- PCA

## Note
- The project discusses the spatial relationships between cities using dimensionality reduction techniques.
- MDS may involve manual rotation or mirroring to achieve desired visualizations.
- PCA might result in rotated or mirrored visualizations depending on the orientation of principal components.

- ## Acknowledgements
- The distances between cities were obtained from https://www.distancecalculator.net/
